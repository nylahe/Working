The mrege file in part El was resolved by first deciding which branch changes you are going to keep.
Then you delete the conflict markers and make the changes you want in the final merge.
Stage your changes then commit your changes.
The three changes made in C1 were to commit each change to the HTML files in the working branch
My messages that I used to commmit the changes were short and simple for all 3 of them
It was simply "adds 3 html files".
